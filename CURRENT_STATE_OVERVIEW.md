## 📊 **DATA STRUCTURE & CURRENT STATE**

### **Critical Data Files**
- `syllabus_jolly_phonics.json` - **PRIMARY ACTIVE SYLLABUS**
- `schedule.json` - Weekly class schedule (Aug 24-30 active)

// Week 1: Aug 24-30 → Status: 'current'
// Week 2: Aug 31-Sep 6 → Status: 'planned'
// Week 0: Before Aug 24 → Status: 'completed'
```
